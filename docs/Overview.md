# Autonauts

## What does the mod do?

This mod aims to bring more life into the minecraft world- with automation! It adds autonauts, which are programmable and modular. They can do what players do.

* Block Breaking
* Block Grabbing
* Block Placing
* Using Items
* Enchanting
* Fishing
* Interacting with Blocks
* Recharging autonauts
* Crafting
* Harvest Crops

It is based off of the game [Autonauts](https://denki.itch.io/autonauts).

You must begin by making an [autonaut workshop](#autonauts) and an [autonaut assembler](#autonauts).

This mod works much like Tinkers Construct, each material having modifiers and traits. It also works like PSI, where you can make instructions for the bot.

You can even [enchant the bots](./Enchantments.md)! Here is the [material information](./BotInformation.md).
